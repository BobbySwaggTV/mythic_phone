# Mythic Phone | WIP
This is a custom phone written for Mythic RP. It is replacing an existing port of GCPhone after having loads of issues with trying to successfully port. This is very much a Work In Progress and you should not even look into using this unless you're prepared to do a shitload of work.

## Dependencies
* Mythic Base | Not Released
* Mythic Inventory | Not Released
* ???

> This is a WIP resource so this dependency list is very likely to expand as features are added.

### Comments
To get the source to fully work, you'll need a SASS compiler as I am using the SASS source of Materialize as well as writing my styling sheets in SASS as it is a far better solution than vanilla CSS. If you use Visual Studio, I'd suggest looking into getting Live SASS Compiler Extension

#### Libraries Used
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/)
* [jQuery Inputmask](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask/tree/2.x/js)
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
